15-Puzzle Solver using A* Search

This project implements a solver for the classic 15-Puzzle (sliding puzzle) using the A* Search Algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic. 
The puzzle consists of a 4x4 grid with 15 numbered tiles and one blank space, and the goal is to arrange the tiles in ascending order with the 
blank tile at the bottom-right corner. The solution involves calculating the most optimal sequence of moves from any valid initial configuration to the goal state.
